      <p class="ProcessParagraph">This is a fun statement about things that happened during the process. It was 
        a good time but also a bad time.Suspendisse ultrices gravida dictum fusce ut placerat orci nulla pellentesque.

          <p class="ProcessParagraphWhite">In 2013 the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (OMNRF, previously OMNR) 
            reclassified and inventoried the shoreline at Lake Simcoe. The data, along with a methodology 
            report was published in 2015. The data and report were provided to us by Silvia Strobl (Regional 
            Operations Division, OMNRF). The shoreline inventory data consisted of 4 feature classes: Shoreline,
             Shoreline Structures, Near-Shore Features, and Outfalls.</p>
          <p class="ProcessParagraphWhite">We decided to explore ESRI software for this solution as ESRI has a number of community engagement
             and narrative applications. These feature classes were uploaded in a geodatabase to ArcGIS online 
             and shared as a hosted feature layer. The hosted feature layer was then opened in Map View Beta and 
             the first iteration of a web map was developed.</p>

        <h2>ESRI Exploration and Rapid Builds</h2>
        <p class="ProcessParagraph">To assess the most appropriate means of communicating the necessary information to solve our 
          problem, we explored WebApp Builder, Dashboards, StoryMaps, and Experience Builder. As our users were not the GIS community,
           having something completely data driven was not appropriate for our solution, thus Dashboards was eliminated. MORE TEXT HERE.</p>
