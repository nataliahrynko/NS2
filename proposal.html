      <p class="ProcessParagraph">This is a fun statement about things that happened during the process. It was 
        a good time but also a bad time.Suspendisse ultrices gravida dictum fusce ut placerat orci nulla pellentesque.

          <p class="ProcessParagraphWhite">In 2013 the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (OMNRF, previously OMNR) 
            reclassified and inventoried the shoreline at Lake Simcoe. The data, along with a methodology 
            report was published in 2015. The data and report were provided to us by Silvia Strobl (Regional 
            Operations Division, OMNRF). The shoreline inventory data consisted of 4 feature classes: Shoreline,
             Shoreline Structures, Near-Shore Features, and Outfalls.</p>
          <p class="ProcessParagraphWhite">We decided to explore ESRI software for this solution as ESRI has a number of community engagement
             and narrative applications. These feature classes were uploaded in a geodatabase to ArcGIS online 
             and shared as a hosted feature layer. The hosted feature layer was then opened in Map View Beta and 
             the first iteration of a web map was developed.</p>

        <h2>ESRI Exploration and Rapid Builds</h2>
        <p class="ProcessParagraph">To assess the most appropriate means of communicating the necessary information 
          to solve our problem, we explored WebApp Builder, Dashboards, StoryMaps, and Experience Builder. As our 
          users were not the GIS community, having something completely data driven was not appropriate for our 
          solution, thus Dashboards was eliminated. While we wanted a guide experience to help teach the public on 
          shoreline alterations, we wanted to maintain some freedom for users to explore data as they desired, thus 
          we eliminated StoryMaps. WebApp Builder was also eleminated as it did not have the narrative capbilities 
          we were looking for. We selected Experience Builder as it combined the narrative aspect of Story Maps and 
          the map-focused aspect of WebApp Builder. Another desirable aspect of Experience Builder was that it was 
          easy to manipulate the Experience for tablet and mobile. </p>
          <p>Using the initial webmap created for our application exploration, we each produced a rapid build Experience.

                widget and a map to provide an interactive tour experience. The idea was to show an overview of Lake 
                Simcoe with an overview of the project and its importance. The user would then be taken on a tour of 
                classifications identified in the study. The bookmark could be timed to automatically take the user on
                 the tour and the last bookmark would explain to the user how to use the map to find their own properties 
                 and explore the area, having learned about the different shoreline features.</p>
