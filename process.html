      <h1>The Process</h1> 
      <p class="ProblemParagraph">As cottagers, our users may not have access to desktop computers which meant we needed software 
        that would work well on tablets and mobile. We needed something that would be easy to modify for smaller screens and required 
        minimal coding. We needed to be able to teach and provide information but not make it overly GIS focused or technically difficult 
        as our users would likely not have this training. This was our process to produce a final web product.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="container-fluid">
      <h2>Data Acquisition and Software Selection</h2> 
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <p class="ProcessParagraphWhite">In 2013 the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (OMNRF, previously OMNR) 
            reclassified and inventoried the shoreline at Lake Simcoe. The data, along with a methodology 
            report was published in 2015. The data and report were provided to us by Silvia Strobl (Regional 
            Operations Division, OMNRF). The shoreline inventory data consisted of four feature classes: Shoreline,
             Shoreline Structures, Near-Shore Features, and Outfalls.</p>
          <p class="ProcessParagraphWhite">We decided to explore ESRI software for this solution as ESRI has a number of community engagement
             and narrative applications. These feature classes were uploaded in a geodatabase to ArcGIS Online 
             and shared as a hosted feature layer. The hosted feature layer was then opened in Map Viewer Beta and 
             the first iteration of a web map was developed.</p>

        <h2>ESRI Exploration and Rapid Builds</h2>
        <p class="ProcessParagraph">To assess the most appropriate means of communicating the necessary information to solve our 
          problem, we explored WebApp Builder, Dashboards, StoryMaps, and Experience Builder. As our users were not the GIS community, 
          having something completely data driven was not appropriate for our solution, thus Dashboards was eliminated. While we wanted 
          a guide experience to help teach the public about shoreline alterations, we wanted to maintain some freedom for users to explore 
          data as they desired, thus we eliminated StoryMaps. WebApp Builder was also eliminated as it did not have the narrative 
          capabilities we were looking for. While exploring the various applications, Sarah tried Experience Builder and used a pre-made 
          template to explore the available functionality. Having shared her findings with the group, Experience Builder was chosen as 
          it combined the narrative aspect of Story Maps and the map-focused aspect of WebApp Builder. Another desirable aspect of 
          Experience Builder was that it was easy to manipulate the Experience for tablet and mobile. </p>
          <p class="ProcessParagraph">Using the initial webmap created for our application exploration, we each produced a rapid build Experience. 
            Apart from the initial trial run performed by Sarah during the various application investigations, no conferring 
            took place until we met to share our creations. [Right-click to view each image to view in full screen.]</p>

              <p class="caption">Sarah chose to use a template for her rapid build. She selected Journey which uses the bookmark 
                widget and a map to provide an interactive tour experience. The idea was to show an overview of Lake 
                Simcoe and outline the project and its importance. The user would then be taken on a tour of 
                classifications identified in the study. The bookmark could be timed to automatically take the user on
                 the tour and the last bookmark would explain to the user how to use the map to find their own properties 
                 and explore the area, having learned about the different shoreline features.</p>

              <p class="caption">Shane chose to build a custom layout for his rapid build. He modeled his after the Journey template that 
                Sarah used, with some major alterations. This prototype was intended to experiment with the overall design of the app and 
                the interactivity between widgets. The primary goal for this prototype was to contain the bookmarks in a scrollable box within 
                a collapsible sidebar. When a bookmark was clicked, the intended behaviour was for the photo and text widgets below to change 
                according to the selected bookmark. However, the Experience Builder is not capable of this without (possibly) custom 
                enhancements. This design was abandoned for a more simple bookmark widget, as used within Sarah’s template.</p>

              <img class="picture" src="images/NatRapid2.png" alt="Natalia's Rapid Build Image 2" width="1918" height="915">
              <p class="caption">Natalia based her Experience off of a more traditional website style. Her Experience walked users
                through definitions of shoreline alterations as they scrolled and introduced the map widget halfway down the page. She 
                also used the bookmark tour idea in this scenario. One aspect of both custom builds was that they were not immediately 
                functional on mobile, so when this Experience was viewed on the smaller screen options, it did not work very well and needed
                further revision of the widget placements.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p class="ProcessParagraph">Completing our own builds allowed us all to explore what Experience Builder had to offer, 
            both positive and negative. The downside to starting with a blank layout was that it wasn't immediately 
            set up for smaller screens. Both Shane and Natalia had issues with their layouts when the smaller screen sizes were selected. 
            A downside to using Experience Builder was that there was limitations to what was possible as there was rigidity in the widget 
            design. The Header widget was applied globally across the three screen sizes. The font size and icons used in the Desktop version 
            applied to the Mobile version; while you could resize the icons you could not resize the text and if you deleted an icon, it would 
            be deleted from all three version (e.g. the menu icon).</p>
          <p class="ProcessParagraph">In the end, we decided that a layout modelled after the Journey template would be the best option, 
            but that we would re-design it from a blank template. One aspect that we hadn't quite figured out was how to best instruct the 
            user how to use the map and the Experience. We wanted a pop-up-like feature that would display when the Experience opened, but we 
            discovered it would require custom programming. We also liked the increased ability to tell information like Natalia's version, 
            but we were not sure how to integrate it.</p>

        <h2>Two Page Experience</h2> 
        <div class="row2">
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <p class="ProcessTextWhite">We decided to combine the Teaching Text aspect of Natalia's build with Sarah's Bookmark Tour to make an Experience that 
              had two pages. The first page would explain the background necessary to understand the data and the second page would house 
              the map with the shoreline feature tour. Natalia produced two versions for us to compare.</p> 
              <p class="ProcessTextWhite"> Between the two options, we preferred the look and feel of the scrollable home page. We choice it 
                because it would feel more familiar to users as it operated like a traditional website. A scrolling template seemed 
                to be more intuitive and also required less engagement with the end-user. Clicking on cards to reveal information involves 
                active viewership and we needed to encourage as much participation as possible. The scrolling screen is less involved 
                and may encourage users to actually read the content as images and text would be immediately displayed.</p>
                <p class="ProcessTextWhite">In the end, however, we felt too constrained by Experience Builder's widgets and format. 
                  Shawn advised us to explore ArcGIS Hub in place of using a two page experience.</p>

                    placed in a collapsible side bar that would provide details on how to use the map.

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <p>As we felt constrained with only using Experience Builder for our Solution, we moved to using ArcGIS Hub 
            in conjunction with Experience Builder. ArcGIS Hub operates like a website but comes as a configurable app. 
            Using Hub would allow us to put as much information as was necessary to educate the property owners without 
            having to clutter one long scrolling page.</p>
          <p>While exploring the functionality of Hub, Sarah created a number of Hubs using premade templates on her developer 
            account. From the four contenders, we settled on the template Outdoor Recreation and created a colour palette that would 
            suit the shoreline project better. When creating a Hub from a template, many ArcGIS Online items are created 
            as well. While many of the additional items created to support the template would have been incredibly useful in community 
            engagement efforts (such as the community events, statistics summaries, and surveys), we knew we didn't have the time or 
            means to properly populate these features. In the future, however, these aspects would be a great benefit to a solution 
            solving a similar problem.

          <p class="ProcessParagraphWhite">Rather than reuse the web map that was being used in the Experience, a new web map was created 
            that could tell the broader story on shoreline importance. We wanted to work from broad to specific, as one might with an 
            introduction paragraph, moving from broad on the first page through to specific on the third where our Experience link was housed. 
            The Experience was being used to show the results of the Lake Simcoe study while the Hub explained the significance of shorelines as

<div class="col-md-4">
  <p>The primary goal of Version 2 was to design a cleaner and simpler version of Sarah’s prototype based on the Journey template whilst implementing 
    features from Shane’s prototype template (namely the sidebar). This version was designed around the navigation buttons at the bottom of the 
    sidebar. The intent was to activate a new bookmark with each button (except for the Legend button, which opened the legend). However, this 
    was beyond the basic functionality of the Experience Builder as activating a button would only make the bookmark appear, but not activate it. 
    This version did, however, serve as an excellent template for Version 3 and the Version 4 (the finalized version).</p>
  <p>Version 3 was refined from Version 2 with Experience Builder’s limitations in mind. The buttons now simply toggled between the legend and the 
    bookmarks, with each bookmark being accessed and activated by clicking the ‘next’ arrow within the widget. Further adjustments and refinements were 
    made to the Web Map, including better symbology and basemap switching from ESRI Topographic to ESRI World Imagery (Clarity) at 1:10,000 scale. 
    Finally, the theme of the application was adjusted to match the colour palette of the ArcGIS Hub that had been built prior to this version. The 
    main pitfalls of this version were its lack of tablet/mobile device support and minor issues with the buttons’ response to window size.</p>
